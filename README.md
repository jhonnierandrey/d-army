# The Room of Requirement
This is a repo for my `code`-practice/learning, experiments and/or for brainstorming.

## The Name: 

The [Room of Requirement] is a magical room which can only be discovered by someone who is in need. It is called the Come and Go Room by the house-elves of Hogwarts. The Room is located on the seventh floor, opposite a tapestry showing Barnabas the Barmy trying to teach trolls to dance the ballet.

When [Dumbledore's Army] needed a place to practice The Room of Requirement delivered. 🧙‍♂️

> If happens that you want to clone/fork this repo, below is how. (This will be my "README.md" template *standard* as well).

>Keep in mind that `source-code` coming from tutorials/articles where I have not rights, I wont be able to share and this will be **.ignored**. Even that, I will try to share the sources-resources when possible.

> By the way, this README.md file is an **idea** / `markdown` practice 🤗.
